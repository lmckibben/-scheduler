# Interview Scheduler
This single page React application allows users to book, cancel, and edit appointments with interviewers.

## Setup

Clone the Repo and install dependencies with `npm install`.
You will also need to clone [scheduler-api](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/scheduler-api).
The app runs on port 8000, and the server for the api runs on 8001.
You will need to have both running for the application to function properly.
