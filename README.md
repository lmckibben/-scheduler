# Interview Scheduler
This single page React application allows users to book, cancel, and edit appointments with interviewers.

## Setup

Clone the Repo and install dependencies with `npm install`.
You will also need to clone [scheduler-api](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/scheduler-api).
The app runs on port 8000, and the server for the api runs on 8001.
You will need to have both running for the application to function properly.
You can run both by using your console in the root directory for each repo and using the command `npm`
